    <br>

    <p style="margin-left:10px;">Everything on this course is a goldmine except for the GUI since it's specific for
      Jupyter Notebooks and it's missing the video for GUI Events.<br>Still it was a nice introduction to GUI. Don't let
      that disappoint you though. THIS IS A MUST HAVE COURSE. I have already recommended it to few people and always
      will.<br>Do yourself a favor and do this course if you want to learn Python 3. Thank you so much for this course,
      Jose-sensei!!</p><br><br>
